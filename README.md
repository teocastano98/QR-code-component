## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


In this project, more than learning something new, I was able to practice some things that I have learned over time, although it is not the most polished semantically/structurally, I was satisfied with the results....what do you think?

```html
<main>
      <section class="card">
        <figure class="card_img">
          <img src="./img/image-qr-code.png" alt="codigo QR">
        </figure>
        <div class="card_caption">
          <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
          <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
```
### Continued development

I would like to emphasize more on the use of classes and selectors, as well as improve the semantics of my html documents.
